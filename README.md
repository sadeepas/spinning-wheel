## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
*   Audio files for sound effects.

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git
    cd your-project-directory
    ```
    If you downloaded a ZIP, extract it.

2.  **Place Audio Files:**
    Ensure you have the following audio files in the same directory as `index.html`, or update the `src` attribute in the `<audio>` tags within `index.html`:
    *   `spin-sound.mp3` (for the wheel spinning - set to loop)
    *   `tick-sound.mp3` (for the ticking sound)
    *   `win-sound.mp3` (for when a prize is won)

    *You'll need to provide these sound files yourself as they are not included in the HTML snippet.*

3.  **Open in Browser:**
    Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## üéÆ How to Use

1.  **Spin the Wheel:**
    *   Click the large "Spin the Wheel!" button at the bottom of the wheel.
    *   The wheel will spin, accompanied by sound effects, and eventually land on a prize.
2.  **View Result:**
    *   A popup will appear displaying the prize you've won.
    *   If you win "Spin Again", the popup button will prompt you to spin once more.
    *   Otherwise, click "Awesome!" or the close button (X) to dismiss the popup.
3.  **Customize the Wheel:**
    *   Click the **cog icon** (‚öôÔ∏è) in the top-right corner to open the Customization Panel.
    *   **Number of Prizes:** Adjust the slider or input field to set how many prizes you want (2-16).
    *   **Prize Details:** For each prize:
        *   **Name:** Enter the text for the prize.
        *   **Color:** Pick a color using the color picker.
        *   **Probability:** Set a value between 0 and 1. The probabilities will be normalized if they don't add up to 1 (or if all are 0, they'll be distributed evenly).
        *   **Delete Prize:** Click the trash icon (üóëÔ∏è) next to a prize to remove it (minimum 2 prizes).
    *   Click "Apply Changes" to update the wheel.
4.  **Fullscreen Mode:**

5.  **Prize Board:**
    *   The panel on the right (or below on smaller screens in fullscreen) lists all configured prizes and their colors.

## üé® Code Highlights

*   **Wheel Rendering (`initWheel()`):**
    *   Dynamically creates wheel segments using `conic-gradient` for colors.
    *   Positions and rotates text labels using CSS transforms, adjusting text placement based on the number of segments for optimal readability.
    *   Implements a threshold (`STACKED_TEXT_THRESHOLD`) for short labels to display them vertically stacked.
*   **Spin Logic (`spinWheel()`):**
    *   Uses CSS `transform: rotate()` and `transition` for smooth spinning animation.
    *   `getWeightedResult()` function determines the winning segment based on configured probabilities.
    *   Calculates rotation degrees including multiple full spins and a random offset for a more natural feel.
*   **Customization (`populateCustomizationForm()`, `applyCustomizationButton`):**
    *   Dynamically generates input fields for each prize.
    *   Handles adding/removing prizes and updates the form accordingly.
    *   Normalizes probabilities upon applying changes.
    *   Re-initializes the wheel with a brief "settling" spin animation.
*   **Fullscreen Styling:**
    *   Uses `:fullscreen` pseudo-class and JavaScript to apply an enhanced, animated background and adjust layout for an immersive experience.
    *   Includes specific CSS animations (`fullscreenPulseAndShift`, `contentEnterFullscreen`) for fullscreen mode.
*   **Sound Management:**
    *   Uses HTML5 `<audio>` elements with `loop` for the spin sound.
    *   Plays tick sounds at intervals during the spin.
    *   Ensures robust playback by catching potential `play()` promise rejections.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements (Ideas)

*   [ ] Option to save/load wheel configurations (e.g., using LocalStorage).
*   [ ] More advanced animation controls (e.g., spin speed, duration).
*   [ ] Different wheel styles or themes.
*   [ ] "No Prize" or "Try Again" segments with distinct styling.
*   [ ] History of wins.
*   [ ] More complex prize types (e.g., image-based prizes).
